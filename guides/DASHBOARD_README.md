## 🎨 Customization

The design system is built with CSS custom properties, making it easy to customize:

- Component styles are modular and in their respective `.css` files
- Layout can be adjusted in the `DashboardLayout` component

## 🔧 Components Structure

```
src/
├── components/
│   ├── layout/
│   │   ├── Sidebar.tsx         # Main navigation sidebar with ROUTES integration
│   │   ├── DashboardLayout.tsx # Layout wrapper with Outlet
│   │   └── DashboardHeader.tsx # Top navigation bar
│   └── ui/
│       └── PlaceholderPage.tsx # Placeholder for future pages
├── pages/
│   ├── ModernDashboard.tsx     # Main dashboard page
│   ├── TransactionsPage.tsx    # Transactions management
│   └── WalletsPage.tsx         # Wallet management
├── router/

└── styles/
    └── pages.css               # Shared page styles
```

## 🎯 Routing Architecture

### Route Flow

```
App.tsx (Authentication Guard)
├── Public Routes: /login, /register
└── Protected Routes: /* → AppRouter
    ├── Layout: DashboardLayout
    └── Pages: /dashboard, /transactions, /wallets, etc.
```

### Key Features

- **Authentication Protection**: All dashboard routes automatically protected
- **Nested Routing**: Clean URL structure without `/app` prefix
- **ROUTES Constants**: Centralized route definitions in `src/constants/index.ts`
- **Relative Navigation**: Sidebar uses ROUTES constants for maintainable navigation
- **Index Redirect**: Root `/` automatically redirects to `/dashboard`
